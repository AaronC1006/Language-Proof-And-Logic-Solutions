# LPL-Solutions

This repository contains all exercises and homeworks done during my first year at the University of Verona, for the "Logica" course. 
It does not have all the exercises, but only the ones i have done. 
Don't contact me for more exercises or explaining of some particulars ones, because i have passed the course 3 years ago and I don't remember anything. 

__Good luck for your exam!__
